# Lockwood Community Church Bylaws

## ARTICLE 1 – COVENANT PARTNERS

1. <ins>Covenant Partners</ins>

    At LCC, Covenant Partners shall be all people who officially covenant together
    and agree to fulfill the vision of LCC. The term "Covenant Partner" shall not be
    deemed to hold any ownership in LCC. Likewise, the term "Covenant Partner"
    referenced herein reflects only a spiritual unity and shall not be deemed to have
    any legal status under State law except what is provided therein.

    We also recognize that there will always be people, both saved and unsaved
    among us who, though not Covenant Partners, come under our regular influence.
    To all such, whether children or adults, we shall extend our love, watch-care, and
    instruction as far and for as long as they shall desire.

2. <ins>Expectations</ins>

    Covenant Partners shall be expected to faithfully attend the regular meetings of
    the church, support its ministry with their prayers and resources and submit
    themselves in the Lord to its Elders’ oversight and direction. They shall maintain a
    life that brings praise and honor to Jesus Christ, engage in mutual edification with
    others in the church and participate from time to time in evangelistic/mission
    opportunities among the unsaved.

    Covenant Partners shall provide advice and give or withhold confirmation, as the
    case may be, with respect to proposals made by the Elders for matters that affect
    the spiritual health and mission of LCC. Regarding all major decisions of LCC, the
    Elders may seek advice from the Covenant Partners. Furthermore, Covenant
    Partners shall cast their vote on church matters presented to them at Covenant
    Partner Meetings.

3. <ins>Eligibility</ins>

    Individuals at LCC may become Covenant Partners if they satisfy the
    following criteria:

       a. Are at least eighteen years of age.
       b. Give satisfactory evidence of being a true believer and follower of
          Jesus Christ.
       c. Give relational indication that they desire to be a regular and responsible
          part of the life and ministry at LCC.
       d. Publicly declare (either verbally or in writing) their intention to become a
          Covenant Partner to the Elders.

4. <ins>Appointment</ins>

    Eligible individuals must present their names to the Elders. After approval, their
    names will be added to the Covenant Partner roster. This Covenant Partnership

    shall be acknowledged through the normal channels of communication in the
    church.

5. <ins>Removal</ins>

    Covenant Partnership may be dissolved at the request of the Covenant Partner
    or at the discretion of the Elders for behaviors inconsistent with discipleship to
    Jesus.

6. <ins>Covenant Partner Meetings</ins>
    The Administrative Board Chairman or Senior Pastor shall preside over all
    church meetings. The Annual State of the Church Meeting shall be held
    (conditions permitting) the fourth Tuesday in January every year. Due notice of
    said meeting shall be given at least two (2) weeks in advance by church
    publication and by announcement.

    The annual meeting will allow for business to be conducted on items that the
    Elders and the Administrative Board decided to include in the agenda and items
    that may come up at the meeting. New items can come up for discussion but not
    be voted on.

    Duly called special meetings may be called by the Administrative Board and/or
    the church family in cooperation with the Elders. Notice of said meetings shall
    include the meeting’s purpose. Voting at special meetings will be limited to what is
    presented in the prepared agenda. New items can come up for discussion but not
    be voted on.

7. <ins>Voting and Quorum</ins>
    A quorum shall consist of all Covenant Partners that are present. No vote
    shall be taken at any meeting except as shall be authorized by the Elders. In
    order to be eligible to vote, a Covenant Partner must be present (in person or
    virtually) to participate in discussions prior to a vote.

### ARTICLE 2 - ELDERS

The Elders are called to oversee the Church of God and to protect it and provide spiritual
guidance. The Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church and LCC is a local expression of
His universal body. The Elders are to submit to His leadership in everything. They will,
therefore, never knowingly contradict biblical principles when making decisions that affect
His work in and through LCC. They will strive to discern God’s plan for LCC through prayer
and the study of Scripture, with watchful attention to God’s activity in and around us.

1. <ins>Role and Authority of Elders</ins>
    The New Testament teaches that the church is to be led by a plurality of godly men
    called “Elders.” They are called by God and affirmed by the Covenant Partners to
    shepherd, teach, pastor, and otherwise give leadership to the local church. This
    includes overseeing the work of the church (its worship, evangelism, edification,
    and equipping); protecting the church from error in doctrine (beliefs) and practice
    (lifestyle); and making sure God’s people are being fed through accurate and
    insightful biblical teaching. God has invested the Elders with the responsibility for
    the leadership of the local church. (Acts 20:28-31; 1 Pet. 5:1-4).

2. <ins>Function of Elders</ins>
    The Elders serve for the purpose of supporting, encouraging, and providing
    accountability for the fulfillment of the church’s vision. They shall vote on
    ratification of the following decisions:

        a. The selection of the Senior Pastor and all ministry leaders.
        b. Termination and/or discipline of the Senior Pastor.

3. <ins>Qualifications of Elders</ins>
    All Elders must be Covenant Partners at LCC. The biblical qualifications of
    Elders are found in 1 Timothy 3:1-7.

4. <ins>Compensation</ins>
The Elders shall not receive any compensation for their services.

5. <ins>The LCC Elder</ins>
    At LCC, the Elders work together to fulfill their responsibilities. Each Elder will
    minister in his area(s) of giftedness and calling while helping the other Elders do
    the same. This work will include, but is not limited to: praying, teaching, planning,
    evaluating, setting ministry direction, delegating ministry responsibilities, modeling
    Christlikeness, and confronting those who oppose biblical truth or practice
    patterns of sinful behavior. The Elders will meet regularly for prayer and counsel
    in the discharge of these duties.

6. <ins>Meetings</ins>
    The Elders shall elect a chairperson to preside over meetings with the default
    position falling to the Senior Pastor. Decisions will be made by consensus. The
    Elders will meet at least 12 times a year and may meet more often as the needs
    of the church demand. Meetings may be in person, via teleconference or web
    conference.

7. <ins>Number of Elders</ins>
    The number of Elders shall not be fewer than three.

8. <ins>Selection of Elders</ins>

    Whenever it appears God may be calling a qualified man to the office of Elder, the
    existing Elders shall approach the suggested individual(s) to determine their interest
    in serving. Suggestions of potential Elders may be given to the Elders by the
    congregation or may originate with the Elders. Potential Elders will be invited to meet
    with the existing Elders for a period not to exceed 6 months. During this time,
    potential Elders may assist with Elder ministries and further explore whether God
    may be calling them to this service. After this time, if the Elders and potential Elder(s)
    believe God has called them to this office, their name(s) shall be submitted to the
    Covenant Partners for affirmation by consensus (as defined in Article VI of
    the LCC Constitution).

    At any time of the year, the Elders may prayerfully submit to the Church qualified
    men (see Article 2, Section 3) for affirmation of their calling to serve as an Elder.
    The church will be given 30 days to submit to the Elders in writing any reasons
    why they doubt either the qualifications or the calling of the person(s) proposed. If
    the Elders find no sufficient cause for disqualification, they will ask the church to
    affirm by ballot the proposed Elder’s calling. If there is consensus (as defined in
    Article VI of the LCC Constitution) of those present at a duly convened meeting of
    the congregation to affirm the calling, the person will be installed as an Elder.

9. <ins>Elders' Term of Service</ins>

    Each Elder will be appointed to a three-year term of service, subject to yearly
    evaluation by fellow Elders. During the period of annual review, both the individual
    Elder and the other Elders will evaluate his continued service in office,
    considering the biblical qualifications as well as any personal factors that might
    affect the fulfillment of his charge. An individual’s service as an Elder may be
    discontinued by his own decision, or by the unanimous decision of the other
    Elders. Leaving the Eldership does not preclude future service in the position,
    subject to the regular Elder selection process. Upon completion of a three-year
    term, an Elder’s name may be placed on the annual ballot for reaffirmation by
    consensus (as defined in Article VI of the LCC Constitution).

10. <ins>Dismissal of Elders</ins>
    Any person may at any time show cause in writing why an Elder should be
    disqualified from service. The Elders will decide, after investigation, if sufficient
    evidence exists to disqualify the Elder in question.

### ARTICLE 3 - ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD

    and four additional members at-large. The Senior Pastor shall serve as an advisory
    member. The Elders, Deacons, and Trustees will each appoint a representative from

    Partners will be formed. The newly formed nominating committee will initiate the
    following process:

        a. The nominating committee will receive instruction from the Elders on the

           Partners and at least one Elder will be appointed by the Elders.
        b. The nominating committee will receive instructions from the Elders on

           committee by the congregation or may originate with the Deacons.

    evaluation by the Elders. An individual’s service as Deacon may be discontinued
    by their own decision or by that of the Elders. Leaving the position of Deacon
    does not preclude future service subject to the regular Deacon selection process
    outlined above. Upon completion of a three-year term, a Deacon’s name shall be
    placed on the annual ballot for reaffirmation by the Covenant Partners by
    consensus (as defined in Article VI of the LCC Constitution).

5. <ins>Dismissal of Deacons</ins>

    Any person may at any time show cause in writing why a Deacon should be
    disqualified from service. The Elders will decide, after investigation, if sufficient
    evidence exists to dismiss the Deacon in question.
